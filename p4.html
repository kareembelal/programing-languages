	<h2>introduction</h2>
</ul>C++, as we all know is an extension to C language and was developed by Bjarne stroustrup at bell labs. C++ is an intermediate level language, as it comprises a confirmation of both high level and low level language features. C++ is a statically typed, free form, multiparadigm, compiled general-purpose language.
C++ is an Object Oriented Programming language but is not purely Object Oriented. Its features like Friend and Virtual, violate some of the very important OOPS features, rendering this language unworthy of being called completely Object Oriented. Its a middle level language.
	<h2>Advantages</h2>
</ul>1. Portability
C++ offers the feature of portability or platform independence which allows the user to run the same program on different operating systems or interfaces at ease.

Suppose you write a program in LINUX OS and for some apparent reason you switch to Windows OS, you would be able to run the same program in windows as well without any error. This feature proves to be of great convenience to the programmer.

2. Object-oriented
One of the biggest advantages of C++ is the feature of object-oriented programming which includes concepts like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, data abstraction, and encapsulation that allow code reusability and makes a program even more reliable.

Not only this, it helps us deal with real-world problems by treating data as an object. C lacked this feature and hence it was created, proving to be of great significance.

This feature gave birth to numerous job prospects and technologies. It is fascinating to note that C++ was created by combining features not only from C but Simula 67, the first object-oriented programming language.

Let’s master the concept of Data Encapsulation in C++ 


3. Multi-paradigm
C++ is a multi-paradigm programming language. The term “Paradigm” refers to the style of programming. It includes logic, structure, and procedure of the program. Generic, imperative, and object-oriented are three paradigms of C++.

Let us now try to understand what generic programming means. Generic programming refers to the use of a single idea to serve several purposes. Imperative programming, on the other hand, refers to the use of statements that change a program’s state.

4. Low-level Manipulation
Since C++ is closely associated with C, which is a procedural language closely related to the machine language, C++ allows low-level manipulation of data at a certain level. Embedded systems and compiler are created with the help of C++.

5. Memory Management
C++ gives the programmer the provision of total control over memory management. This can be considered both as an asset and a liability as this increases the responsibility of the user to manage memory rather than it being managed by the Garbage collector. This concept is implemented with the help of DMA (Dynamic memory allocation) using pointers.

6. Large Community Support
C++ has a large community that supports it by providing online courses and lectures, both paid and unpaid. Statistically speaking, C++ is the 6th most used and followed tag on StackOverflow and GitHub.

7. Compatibility with C
C++ is pretty much compatible with C. Virtually, every error-free C program is a valid C++ program. Depending on the compiler used, every program of C++ can run on a file with .cpp extension.


8. Scalability
Scalability refers to the ability of a program to scale. It means that the C++ program is capable of running on a small scale as well as a large scale of data. We can also build applications that are resource intensive.
	<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
</ul>1. Use of Pointers
Pointers in C/C++ are a relatively difficult concept to grasp and it consumes a lot of memory. Misuse of pointers like wild pointers may cause the system to crash or behave anomalously.

2. Security Issue
Although object-oriented programming offers a lot of security to the data being handled as compared to other programming languages that are not object-oriented, like C, certain security issues still exist due to the availability of friend functions, global variables and, pointers.

3. Absence of Garbage Collector
As discussed earlier, C++ gives the user complete control of managing the computer memory using DMA. C++ lacks the feature of a garbage collector to automatically filter out unnecessary data.

4. Absence of Built-in Thread
C++ does not support any built-in threads. Threads is a relatively new concept in C++ which wasn’t initially there. Now, C++ is capable of supporting lambda functions.
